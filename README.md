I *really* need to blog about this...

This project is basically my gateway into actually learning VHDL.
I've already succeeded in implementing a straightforward "C-to-VHDL"
translation of the algorithm, with the HW side fully implementing the
computation of a complete frame, storing it in SRAM, and then sending it
back to the main PC over the USB bus.

Now I need to *actually* do HW - that is to say, pipeline this so it
becomes 100 times faster!
